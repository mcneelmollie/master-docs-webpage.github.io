  <p>Engaged couples gathered Thursday in downtown Chicago to experience a wedding exposé unlike any other. </p>
  
  <p>Founded in 2008, the Big Fake Wedding allows vendors to showcase their products and services to couples under the guise of a real wedding. The initial event originated in Atlanta, GA and was such a success that it now to travels to cities across the country.</p>
  
  <p>The Chicago event was held at the Builders Building located at 222 N. LaSalle Blvd. For $25, guests were able to check out 30-35 local vendors in action during a night that featured everything from a ceremony and cocktail hour to food and decorations.  The wedding for each event may be fake, but the couple acting as bride and groom is not. In fact, they are already married and using the event to renew their vows.</p>

  <p>The night started with a cocktail hour: champagne flutes stacked as a pyramid, black-tie waiters wielding silver trays full of yummy finger foods and a local band playing jazzy music in the background. As the time for the ceremony approached, staff members moved a flowery backdrop towards the large central staircase, transforming the dining room space into a ceremonial hall. The groom and bridal party laughed while waiting for the bride’s entrance.  A singer began her solo, and a hush fell over the room as the bride walked up the isle.  The officiant joked about the guests being strangers then continued with the ceremony. After the couple was re-presented as Mr. and Mrs., the party began.  Guests danced with the newly re-weds, exchanged wedding ideas and mingled with vendors responsible for the idyllic atmosphere. </p>

  <p>For brides and grooms, the event served as a source of inspiration, a networking opportunity to meet local vendors and an exciting reminder that their own big day is soon approaching. </p>
  
  <p>“You really get the full experience: food, music and booze,” said bride-to-be Beth Preece, “it’s like walking in your guest’s shoes.”</p>
  
  <p>For participating vendors, the event allowed them to showcase their unique services in an enjoyable way, while also making connections with other vendors in the wedding industry. </p>

  <p>Carla Bejan-Negru, a florist at Elena’s Garden Floral Designs, explained, “you not only get to meet potential clients…you get to know the other vendors as well. The Big Fake Wedding promotes vendor relations which is really helpful in getting your name out.”</p>

  <p>Each vendor performed their services as they would at a real wedding, while “guests” experienced great music, enjoyed tasty cakes and marveled at beautiful flowers. </p>

  <p>The event’s director of operations, Julia Ward, explained the selection process. “We like vendors that are a little different. Our ideal vendor is someone who isn’t too big and well-known but is still experienced,” she said. Ward continued her explanation by saying, “the three main goals of this event were to inspire brides and grooms, promote small local businesses and encourage solid and committed marriages.” </p>
  
  <p> The event benefited all involved parties in that brides were shown the latest wedding trends, grooms were able to sample the food and vendors found new clients. </p>
